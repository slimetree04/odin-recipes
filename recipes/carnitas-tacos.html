    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Almost every culture has its own take on roast pork shoulder, but none are quite like the tender, crispy-edged, and garlic-studded goodness that is carnitas. This preparation of Mexico’s slow-cooked pulled pork is classic and a bit time consuming, but worth every single second: It’s the ultimate confit, and a great example of the delicious results you can accomplish with low-and-slow cooking. Once made, these crispy, flavorful carnitas will be key to upgrading every taco night, or practically any weeknight dinner.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 lb boneless pork shoulder cut into 2 inch chunks</li>
        <li>1 tbsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 large onion, cut into eighths</li>
        <li>6 large cloves garlic, smashed</li>
        <li>6 sprigs oregano</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 large navel orange, cut into eighths</li>
        <li>1 cup pork lard</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325°. In a 13" x 9" baking dish, sprinkle pork with salt, cumin, and cayenne and toss to coat. Spread out pork in baking dish and place onion, garlic, oregano, and bay leaves in between pork pieces. Squeeze juice from orange wedges over pork, then nestle wedges into dish.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan over medium heat, cook lard, stirring occasionally, until melted. Pour lard over pork mixture and cover with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake pork 2 hours. Uncover pan and increase oven temperature to 450°. Using tongs, remove and discard oregano, bay leaves, and orange wedges. Using a ladle, remove and discard 1 1/2 cups fat. Continue to bake, turning pork halfway through, until browned on all sides, about 45 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Using 2 forks, shred pork, then toss with garlic and onions. Transfer carnitas to a platter. Assemble tacos.</li>
