        <li>3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 tbsp honey</li>

        <li>Uncover and return chicken and any accumulated juices to skillet. Cook, stirring, until sauce is thickened and chicken and broccoli are well coated, 1 to 2 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Divide rice among plates or bowls. Spoon stir-fry over. Top with sesame seeds.</li>
